# Probabilistic Robotics Playground: 2D Mobile Robot Simulation Environment
> **Developed by [your name here!]**

## Repository Overview and Vision
This repository is meant to be a starting point for creativity and self-guided learning for the _Probabilistic Robotics_ course at Olin College of Engineering, providing an initial skeleton for a mobile robot simulation environment. Assignments throughout the course will revisit this simulator: building out more of its capabilities, utilizing it to investigate particular algorithms and methods, and providing a start for deep dive projects that push the class materials even further.

## File Structure
```bash
├── src/
├── input/
├── output/
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
```

`src` houses the source code for this project.

`input` houses example input files that configure the simulator.

`output` houses output files generated by the simulator.

## How to Use This Repository
This repository is a skeleton for you to use as a starting point for your own robot simulation environment! You should use the existing architecture and scaffolding as much as is useful for your learning, and you are welcome to structure the simulator however you see fit. The `src/` folder contains a basic outline of recommended files, classes, and functions, but these are by no means a requirement or a complete pipeline.

If you'd like to follow a more guided walkthrough of how to build this simulator, check out the `simulator.md` file. Reference code is also available on the main branch of this repository in case you get stuck on anything!
