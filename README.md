## Repository Overview and Vision
This repository is meant to be a starting point for creativity and self-guided learning for the _Probabilistic Robotics_ course at Olin College of Engineering, providing an initial skeleton for a mobile robot simulation environment. Assignments throughout the course will revisit this simulator: building out more of its capabilities, utilizing it to investigate particular algorithms and methods, and providing a start for deep dive projects that push the class materials even further.

## How to Use This Repository
Please fork your own copy of this repo into your own github account, and then clone that repository onto your local development machine. You will be building your own simulators throughout the course of this assignment, and will submit a link to specific branches of your cloned repository for assignment submissions.

## Running a Minimal Example
A minimal example of a 2D mobile robot moving in an obstacle-laden environment is implemented in this repository for your reference. To run this example, in your terminal type:
