"""
A simulated robotic agent with teleoperation and sensing capabilities.

The Robot class models the robotic agent that explores the world. The robot is remote-controlled by angular and linear velocity commands read from an external file. The robot can execute motor commands to move, and can sense both externally (GPS, landmarks, obstacles) and internally (odometry, IMU).
